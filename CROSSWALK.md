# Crosswalk with FAIR4RS Principles

We summarize below how sPARcRNA_Viz aligns with the FAIR4RS Principles. A description of the compliance is provided to help users understand how the software aligns with the principles. The compliance is scored on a scale of 0 to 2, where 0 indicates no compliance, 1 indicates partial compliance, and 2 indicates full compliance. An N/A indicates that the principle is not applicable to the software. The compliance is based on the information provided in the software repository and the Zenodo record.

| F1. Software is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier.                                  | 2     | Our software application has been assigned a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) that is unique and persistent. We are using Zenodo to assign a DOI to our software.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| F1.1. Components of the software representing levels of granularity are assigned distinct identifiers. | 2     | The software components are assigned distinct identifiers. SoftWare Heritage persistent IDentifier (SWHID) is a unique identifier that will assign a distinct identifier to each component of the software (eg. source code, releases, files, commits, code fragments, etc.).                                                              |
| F1.2. Different versions of the software are assigned distinct identifiers.                            | 2     | Different versions of the software are assigned distinct identifiers. The software is versioned using the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) scheme. Each version of the software is assigned a unique identifier via the Zenodo release process.                                                                                                |

The metadata includes information about the software, such as the title, authors, description, keywords, license, and funding information. The metadata is provided in the Zenodo record for the software. We also have included codemeta.json and CITATION.cff files within the repository. |
| F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the software they describe.              | 2     | The metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the software they describe.

The metadata are provided in a machine-readable format (JSON) and are indexed by Zenodo.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| A1. Software is retrievable by its identifier using a standardised communications protocol.            | 2     | The http protocol is used to retrieve the software by its identifier. The software is hosted on Zenodo, which provides a standardised communications protocol for accessing the software.                                                                                                                                                  |
| A1.1. The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable.                                       | 2     | The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable. The software is hosted on Zenodo, which is an open-access repository. Everything on Software Heritage is open access.                                                                                                                                                           |
| A1.2. The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary.          | N/A   | Zenodo has a process in place to handle closed or embargoed access, but this application is publicly available and does not require authentication or authorization.                                                                                                                                                                       |
