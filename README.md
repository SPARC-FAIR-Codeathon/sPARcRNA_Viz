General Notes: 
- Not yet sure if there is a standard rubric/requirements for the readme, currently working to find that out
- Importantly, the 2 most recent winning README's are partly authored by the same person, explaining the similarity
- IMPORTANT: The "problem" and "solution" sections may currently be too similar to previous README's, maybe different language or structure could be used here

A logo and possible slogan could potentially be included, as is the case with the KnowMore project
## Table of Contents
- "
## About
- Probably mention FAIR in this brief tool description
## Introduction
- Broad description of the technology, specifically mentioning its connection to the SPARC portal
- Maybe a summary of notable features
## Background
- Maybe some broad scientific background behind differential expression
## Importance of FAIR Principles
- Maybe description of importance of FAIR as relates specifically to RNA-seq research
- Maybe we could include a diagram here to add visual interest to this section
## Current SPARC Portal Tools
- Details about Transcriptomic_oSPARC, citing accordingly
## The Problem
- Gene expression visualization integratable (one might even say â€¦ interoperable) with SPARC, with a focus on FAIR Principles
## Our Solution: <Team 7 Project Name>
- Detailed discussion of inputs, outputs, pipeline
- These could all be separate subheadings to maintain organization
- Can make diagrams to enhance the text
## FAIR-Centered Design
- Specific discussion of how our design is more FAIR than existing
## Setting Up <Team 7 Project Name>
- Prerequisites, commands to run, dependencies, etc.
## Using <Team 7 Project Name>
- Maybe include required input formats
- Output formats
- Maybe any parameters to be adjusted
## Tutorial
- Maybe some kind of tutorial if applicable and we have extra time
- This could possibly consist of sample inputs
## Cite Us
- All of the winning projects included a citation
## License
- All of the winning projects included a license
## FAIR Practices
- All of the winning projects linked to a <ins>separate</ins> FAIR document here
- Here we could reference the specific FAIR rubric, as is done in the other winning projects
- FAIR principles will be the last thing they see :)
## Team
- It seems all the Grand Prize-winning teams listed the recommended team roles here (Lead, Writer, Sysadmin, etc.)
## Materials Cited
- Here we could potentially put materials cited (maybe scientific papers, SPARC articles, etc.)
- Possibly cite Canva or similar if we make diagrams
## Acknowledgements
- Thanking the SPARC team
